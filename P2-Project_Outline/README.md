## Submission Instructions

### Overview
During my job I need to drive to multiple locations that aren't given to me in the most efficient route.
Since I work for commission and not an hourly pay it would be beneficial for me to have the 
least possible amount of drive time possible so I wanted to make an app where you can put in
all of the locations you need to go to then spits out the fastest route all the way back to
a starting location.
### Features
1. A home location where you will start and end your routes. This will most likely be where your work
is located and will be used repeatedly. For this reason, you can save your home for easier access to them.

2. A location list where you can add, and remove places where you need to go to.

3. A page showing you the map of your route you need to take.
